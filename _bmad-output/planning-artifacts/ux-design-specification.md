# UX Design Specification - Panopticon

**Author:** Andre

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

Panopticon is an operational dashboard that transforms reactive lead management into proactive accountability. Built for speed and simplicity, it gives the Lead Gen Coordinator instant visibility into appointed leads requiring intervention—replacing mental tracking with systematic, visual triage.

The dashboard answers one question every morning: "Which leads need my attention right now?"

### Target Users

**Primary User: Damione Blasdell**
- **Role:** Lead Gen Coordinator at Naturals2Go/VendTech
- **Context:** Desktop at office, once-daily check while rushing between tasks
- **Tech comfort:** Prefers simple, obvious interfaces—no learning curve
- **Information preference:** Dense data visibility; wants everything at once
- **Action pattern:** Identifies problem → calls or emails the responsible locator

**Key User Needs:**
- Instant recognition of which leads are stale or at-risk
- Locator contact info immediately accessible for action
- Zero navigation required to see what matters
- Confidence that nothing is slipping through the cracks

### Key Design Challenges

1. **Speed over polish:** Interface must surface critical info instantly with zero hunting. Damione is rushing—every click costs time.

2. **Dense but scannable:** Everything visible at once, but stale/at-risk leads must visually pop. Density without overwhelm.

3. **Action-ready data:** Path from "see problem" to "contact locator" must be frictionless. Locator info immediately available.

### Design Opportunities

1. **Visual triage system:** Color-coded status (red=stale, yellow=at-risk, green=healthy) enables scanning 50+ leads in seconds.

2. **Morning briefing default:** App opens directly to "what needs attention"—no configuration, no navigation required.

3. **Locator-centric grouping:** Group stale leads by locator to enable batched intervention ("Marcus has 3 stale leads" → one call).
